# Project: Car Rental Program

## Problem Statement
This project involves the development of a Car Rental Program using C++. The program is designed to simulate a simple car rental system where users can select a car model, enter the number of rental hours, and receive the total rental cost. The system is menu-driven and allows users to perform multiple rentals in a single run.

---

## Purpose
This project tests the ability to:
- Apply the fundamental of C++ programming
- Practice use of functions, loop, and repeatitions
- Perform correct calculation based on different requirements

---

## Overview
The Car Rental Program is a menu-driven system that allows users to:
- View the list of available cars
- Rent a car by choosing a model and entering rental hours
- Calculate rental costs based on hourly rates and rate increases
- Display a complete rental summary

---

## Objective of Program
- Ensure correct validation for menu and car model selction
- Use functions to calculate the cost efficiently
- Control program flow using loops
- Produce accurate and readable output for users
---

## Rental Rate Rules
- First 12 hours: Normal hourly rate
- 12 to 24 hours: Hourly rate with an additional 2% increment
- More than 24 hours: Hourly rate with an additional 5% increment

---

## Program Flow
1. Display the menu
2. Prompt user to select a car model
3. Request number of rental hours
4. Validate user inputs
5. Calculate the cost
6. Display a detailed rental summary
7. Confirmation to proceed or exit
8. Repeat based on user decision

---

## Conclusion
This project will provide a valuable hands-on experience in developing a complete C++ program. It helps in improving my understanding of:
- Functions and parameter passing
- Input validation techniques
- Conditional and loop control structures

Overall, this program successfully demonstrate the practical application of C++ in solving real-world problems.
